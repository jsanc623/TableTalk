API Plan
========

The root of the application will revolve around an API. This API will 
be built on a RESTful PHP MVC framework. Data will be encapsulated in 
valid JSON for transport. Authentication will mimic oAuth 1.0A for 
launch, and later will be converted to a meed full oAuth 2.0 spec.

API Methods
===========

> *Authentication*
* userLogin(username, password, timestamp)
* userLogout(username, timestamp)
