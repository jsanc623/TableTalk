What is TableTalk?
==================

A service that restaurants can sign up for to let patrons flag down the waitstaff, 
order meal items, etc, thereby letting them dine peacefully without interruptions 
and freeing up the staff to only go to tables where they are actually needed. Ends 
the "And how's everything?" questions. 


Initial Ideas
=============

+ Waitstaff already carry cellphones, WiFi enabled so no SMS charges.
+ NFC, QR, GPOS, or some other form to get the restaurant code available to the customer.
+ Two way communication (restaurant can make suggestions, specials, etc)
+ Eliminates unnecessary interaction.

Domain Name Ideas
=================

+ TableTalk.me (Working Name)
+ Table-Smart.co
+ Tablewise.me
+ Dinetimate.com (combination of Dine/Intimate)
+ Dintimate.com
